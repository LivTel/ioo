Utility board code.
Copied from e2v230 which contains Bob Leaches latest code.
Created utilwine to compile assember into DSP .lod file using wine (on ltdevsrv).

Coped over filter wheel code from /home/dev/src/sdsu/astro-cam/1.7/ngat (RATCam mode), and
modified it for one wheel. This is DC motor code.
