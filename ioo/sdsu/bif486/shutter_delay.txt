Check #SHUT in X:STATUS is set.

As part of START_EXPOSURE sequence:

NB no delay for opening shutter

; Delay readout until the shutter has fully closed
	MOVE	Y:<SHDEL,A
	TST	A
	JLE	<S_DEL0
	MOVE	#100000,X0
	DO	A,S_DEL0		; Delay by Y:SHDEL milliseconds
	DO	X0,S_DEL1
	NOP
S_DEL1	NOP
S_DEL0	NOP

; Shutter subroutines
OSHUT	BSET    #ST_SHUT,X:<STATUS 	; Set status bit to mean shutter open
	MOVE	#0,X0
	JSR	<SET_SHUTTER_STATE
	RTS

CSHUT	BCLR    #ST_SHUT,X:<STATUS 	; Clear status to mean shutter closed
	MOVE	#>$10,X0
	JSR	<SET_SHUTTER_STATE
	RTS
