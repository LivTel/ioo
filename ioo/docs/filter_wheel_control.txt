O Filter Wheel Control
======================

Version: $Revision: 1.1 $

Initial document created as a result of a chat with SDB on 13/6/11.

O filter wheel has 12 positions

- 3 x 'locators' that can be driven in and out under pneumatic control
- Motor
- Clutch cyclinder
- 6 x proximity switches
- 5 x actuators that trigger the proximity switches

Locators
========

- 1 output bit, set drive in (say), clear drive out under pneumatic control
- 2 input bits (x3 = 6 in total)
  - 1 set if locator is driven in
  - 1 set if locator is driven out
  - if no bits set, locator is moving
  - if both bits set, this is an error

Motor
=====

- 1 output bit, set on (say).

24v. Currently not reversable, this could change if needed.

Clutch Cylinder
===============

- 1 bit output, set means motor drive engaged (say), clear means motor is not engaged.
- 2 bits input
  - 1 bit set if engaged
  - 1 bit set if disengaged
  - 0 bits set, transitions between engaged/disengaged
  - both bits set - error.

Proximity Switches
==================

1 bit input - set if over an actuator.

A different set of proximity switches are set for each filter wheel position.
This position set is not decided yet.

Suggested movement procedure
============================

- Set 'Clutch Cylinder engage' bit, wait until 'Clutch Cylinder Engaged' input bit is set
- Clear 'Locator Output Bit' (drive out), wait until 'Locator is Driven Out' input bit is set (x3).
- Set 'Motor Bit'
- Enter loop, reading 'Proximity Switches' input bits, Look for specified pattern, timeout if not found (or pattern
   does not change) within a certain time period.
- Set 'Locator Output Bit' (drive in)
- Clear 'Clutch Cylinder engage' bit (disengage clutch).
- Wait until 'Clutch Cylinder Disengaged' input bit is set.
- Clear 'Motor Bit'
- Wait until 'Locator is Driven In' input bit is set (x3).
- Recheck 'Proximity Switches' input bits against specified pattern.


Homing
======

There is no home sensor, hence no real concept of home.
Homing will just consist of moving the wheel to a known position.
