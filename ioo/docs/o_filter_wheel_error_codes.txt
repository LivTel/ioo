Here are the internal filter wheel error codes (generated by the SDSU utility board).
These appear in O filter wheel errors as follows:

01/12/2011 05:53:47 CCD_Filter_Wheel:Error(2) : Move:Failed with error code:<n>.

Where <n> means

Code  Command	Reason					Explanation
1     Move	Y:FW_LAST_POS < 0			The wheel was not reset/homed before move was called
2     Move	Y:FW_TARGET_POS < 0			The position to move to was less than zero.
3     Reset/ISR	(Y:<DIG_IN&DIG_IN_PROXIMITY_MASK) matches no patterns in FW_PROXIMITY_PATTERN We have stopped a reset with the proximity sensors matching no known position.
6     Both/ISR	FW_TIMEOUT_INDEX >= Y:FW_TIMEOUT_COUNT	Timeout whilst trying to move locators out.
7     Both/ISR	FW_TIMEOUT_INDEX >= Y:FW_TIMEOUT_COUNT	Timeout whilst trying to move out of a position (at least 1 proximity bit is clear (=in proximity) , waiting for all to be set.
8     Both/ISR	FW_TIMEOUT_INDEX >= Y:FW_TIMEOUT_COUNT	Timeout whilst trying to move locators in.
9     Abort	Aborting				We are aborting a move/reset.
10    Move/ISR	(Y:<DIG_IN&DIG_IN_PROXIMITY_MASK) != Y:<FW_TARGET_PROXIMITY_PATTERN We have stopped moving in the wrong position
11    Both/ISR	FW_TIMEOUT_INDEX >= Y:FW_TIMEOUT_COUNT	Timeout whilst trying to move in to a position (all proximity bits set, waiting for one to go clear = in proximity).
